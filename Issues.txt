Issue 1: Form Submission in CreateList.jsx

When you submit the form from "/src/pages/CreateList.jsx," the numbers are being converted to strings. To fix this, you should convert them back to numbers using the following condition: if (+discountedPrice >= +regularPrice).

Issue 2: Importing CSS for Lazy Loading Images

For the lazy loading image component to work, you need to import the "blur.css" file from "react-lazy-load-image-component/src/effects/blur.css."

Issue 3: Compatibility of react-moment with Vite

The "react-moment" package doesn't work with Vite. To make it work, you should follow these steps:

    Install the "npm i @originjs/vite-plugin-commonjs" package.
    Update your Vite config with the following code:

import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import { esbuildCommonjs } from "@originjs/vite-plugin-commonjs";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  optimizeDeps: {
    esbuildOptions: {
      plugins: [esbuildCommonjs(["react-moment"])],
    },
  },
});
